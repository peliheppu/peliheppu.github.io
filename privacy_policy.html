      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>
        Our privacy policy is really simple: we don't collect or store any of your data, or track your usage in any way.
      </p>
      <p>
      While we do not collect any personal information, we do use the following third-party services that might do so.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do use <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/in-app-review">Google Play In-App Review API</a>,
        which may prompt users to submit Play Store ratings and reviews.
        All review interactions are handled directly by Google, and we do not see or access any personal details.
        You can find more information from their <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/in-app-review#in-app_reviews">data safety statement</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also use <a href="https://developers.google.com/admob/android/privacy/play-data-disclosure">Google Play AdMob Mobile Ads SDK</a> to display advertisements in our app.
        You can find more information about the data collected and shared automatically by the AdMob SDK from 
        <a href="https://developers.google.com/admob/android/privacy/play-data-disclosure?#data_collected_and_shared_automatically">here</a>.
        Since our app is suitable for users of all ages, including children under 13,
        we have configured AdMob to serve only child-appropriate, non-personalized ads.
